      "Hello. My name is Rajan and I’m a self taught javascript programmer. I landed a job entirely on the basis of my skills. This has all happened as I’m very intrigued and genuinely interested in Javascript and development. I’m in a state where I feel like I should be grilled by problems everyday to even sharpen my skills. I can assure you I can complete tasks within time and will add value to your team if given a chance. I started to freelance work in Upwork and linkedin and always knee to move ahead with such companies and great work.",
